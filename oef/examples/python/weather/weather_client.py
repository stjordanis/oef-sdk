"""
Weather client agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This script belongs to the ``weather`` example of OEF Agent development, and implements the weather client agent.
It assumes that an instance of the OEF Node is running at ``127.0.0.1:10000``.
The script does the following:
1. Instantiate a ``WeatherClientAgent``
2. Connect the agent to the OEF Node.
3. Make a query on ``echo`` services via the ``search_services`` method.
4. Run the agent, waiting for messages from the OEF.
The class ``WeatherClientAgent`` define the behaviour of the weather client agent. In summary:
* when the agent receives a search result from the OEF (see ``on_search_result``), it sends a CFP to
  every weather station found. This message starts a negotiation with every agent.
  For simplicity, the CFP contains a query with an empty list of constraints, meaning that we do not specify constraints
  on the set of proposals we can receive.
* when the agent receives a Propose message, he will automatically accept the proposal, sending an Accept message.
  Here it is possible to implement multiple strategies, e.g. find the proposal with the minimum
  across different services.
* Then he waits to receive the measurements from the weather station.
It would be nice to extend this example to work with multiple weather stations, and pick the one with the minimum price.
